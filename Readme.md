Conference Track Management Solutions

There could be many ways to approach the solution. I decide to go further with a functional design for the solution of this problem, developing a greedy algorithm.

This solution required improvement (not limited to)

e.g. •	Adding the proper log information.

•	Adding the appropriate exceptions, error handling,

•	If missing information available then add those constraints as well.

•	Currently it depicts one solution where it has exercised only one test-input it required to test various other talks input values.

•	Various cosmetic things e.g. add/remove comments, add/remove variables/methods

Steps to compile and run this solution
